TypeScript has several built-in type primitives that can be used to define variables, function parameters, and return types:

* `number`: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
* `string`: Represents textual data
* `boolean`: Represents logical values, which can be either true or false.
* `null`: Represents the absence of a value.
* `undefined`: Represents a value that has not been assigned or has not been defined.
* `symbol`: Represents a unique identifier. Symbols are typically used as keys for object properties.
* `bigint`: Represents arbitrary-precision integers.
* `any`: Represents a dynamic or unknown type. Variables of type any can hold values of any type, and they bypass type checking.
* `void`: Represents the absence of any type. It is commonly used as the return type of functions that do not return a value.
* `never`: Represents a type for values that never occur. It is typically used as the return type of functions that throw an error or enter an infinite loop.
