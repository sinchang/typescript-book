Mapped Type Modifiers in TypeScript enable the transformation of properties within an existing type:

* `readonly` or `+readonly`: This renders a property in the mapped type as read-only.
* `-readonly`: This allows a property in the mapped type to be mutable.
* `?`: This designates a property in the mapped type as optional.

Examples:

```typescript
type ReadOnly<T> = { readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] }; // All properties marked as read-only

type Mutable<T> = { -readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] }; // All properties marked as mutable

type MyPartial<T> = { [P in keyof T]?: T[P] }; // All properties marked as optional
```
